# Project: 
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

This folder contains all the .R files which will be sourced when running the final_report.

Also, it contains some intermediate .Rmd files which are all included in the final_report. You do not have to run these .Rmd files.
